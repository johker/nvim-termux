### About 
Setup of neovim on Android based on [the Primeagen](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=w7i4amO_zaE). It includes some slight modifications compared to the original to work better on Termux.

### Prerequisites
To install rust-analyzer use the Termux package manager (Mason install does not work)
```bash 
pkg install rust-analyzer
```
